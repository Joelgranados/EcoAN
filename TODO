*   Incorporate picture metadata:  We should have a list of metadata from the
    picture xml file.
*   A Colleague had a great idea.  Take 4 (or more) pictures of the plot.  Then you
    will have 4 different prespectives of the same plot of the same day.  This
    will allow you to have different perspectives when you annotate.  They way
    you can show the four different perspectives is for the user to click on the
    annotation and all the perspectives of that annotation will be shown.
    AWESOME!!!!
*   Another great feature would be to be able to go from the normalized image to
    the original image.  This back and forth process might ease the detection.
*   Don't connect to the db on every call to the annHandler class.
