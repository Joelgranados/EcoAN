*   Incorporate picture metadata:  We should have a list of metadata from the
    picture xml file.
*   A Colleague had a great idea.  Take 4 (or more) pictures of the plot.  Then you
    will have 4 different prespectives of the same plot of the same day.  This
    will allow you to have different perspectives when you annotate.  They way
    you can show the four different perspectives is for the user to click on the
    annotation and all the perspectives of that annotation will be shown.
    AWESOME!!!!
