*   Remove list feature:  Create a work flow to remove all the files that are
    currently on the file list.

*   Incorporate labels in correction state:  Instead of having to erase the
    annotation to correct it, one might want to just change the label.  This
    is very logical because the error in annotation should be in the label
    and not in the box.

*   Incorporate picture metadata:  We should have a list of metadata from the
    picture xml file.

*   Reviewd feature: Add a feature to identify the files that have already
    been reviewd.  Include Persons name and date of review.
