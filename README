Some hints on how to make this work:

1. Everything is done using ssh passwordless connection.  You have to set this
   up before doing anything.  Follow any tutorial on setting up the ssh key
   between two boxes.  You can start on http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/152
   You know that you have configured this correctly when you can do a `ssh user@server ls`
   without any password.

2. Watch out for errors with the ssh command.  I had to change my hosts file because
   the server I was connecting too had its reverse DNS busted.

3. The connection might take some time, specially if you have a slow connection.
   Good thing is that in the worst case scenario you will have to download the
   images only once.

4. This is not tested on windows.  I'm guessing that the commands just need translating
   from unix to windows.  Some work for the future.

5. Make sure you place the exact path to the directory were the png files are located
   in the server.  place this under ssh_dir in the config file.

6. Make sure to place the user that should be used for the ssh connection.  This is
   the user that for which you configured the ssh passwordless connection.

7. Make sure you specify the cache directory.  It defaults to cache in the current
   dir.

8. On the "local machine" edit the ~/.ssh/config file so that you are sure that
   your newly created credentials are used.  This is very related to 1.
   <snip>
   Host example.com
   User username
   IdentityFile ~/PATH/TO/RSA
   <snap>

9. It only works with png files (for the moment).  It would be easy to extend it.
